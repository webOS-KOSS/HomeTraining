 * The following classes are supported:
 * *  `transition`      - The root component class
 * *  `inner`           - The element inside the transition. This is the container for the transitioning content.
 * *  `shown`           - Applied when content is present (visible), related to the  `visible`  prop/state
 * *  `hidden`          - Applied when content is not present (hiding), related to the  `visible`  prop/state
 * *  `slide`           - Applied when the  `slide`   `type`  is set
 * *  `fade`            - Applied when the  `fade`   `type`  is set
 * *  `clip`            - Applied when the  `clip`   `type`  is set
 * *  `up`              - Applied when the  `direction`   `up`  is set
 * *  `right`           - Applied when the  `direction`   `right`  is set
 * *  `down`            - Applied when the  `direction`   `down`  is set
 * *  `left`            - Applied when the  `direction`   `left`  is set

and not visible, onto the screen. Think of a popup, toast, notification, dialog, or
an overlaying menu. This requires no re-rendering or repainting of the screen during
the transition, making it very performant. However, this does not affect layout at
all, which makes it less useful for transitioning from a place already on the
screen.
 * *  `'clip'`  - This is useful for showing a component that transitions-in from a location
that is already on the screen. Examples would be an expanding header or an
accordion. This type does affects layout, its current size will push other sibling
elements to make room for itself. Because of this, repainting the layout does happen
during transition.
 * *  `'fade'`  - Fade the components onto the screen, from 0 opacity (completely invisible)
to 1 (full visibility). Pretty basic, but useful for fading on/off a tooltip, a
menu, a panel, or even view contents. This does not affect layout at all.
